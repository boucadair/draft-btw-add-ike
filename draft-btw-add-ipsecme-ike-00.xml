    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a new Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version
      2 (IKEv2) Configuration Payload Attribute Type for encrypted DNS such as
      DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) and DNS-over-TLS (DoT).</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document specifies encrypted DNS configuration for an IKE
      initiator, particularly the Authentication Domain Name (ADN, defined in
      <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>) of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref> or DNS-over-TLS (DoT) <xref
      target="RFC7858"></xref> server using Internet Key Exchange Protocol
      Version 2 (IKEv2) <xref target="RFC7296"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Particularly, this document introduces a new IKEv2 Configuration
      Payload Attribute Types (<xref target="RI"></xref>) for the support of
      encrypted DNS servers (e.g., DoT, DoH).</t>

      <t>Sample use cases are discussed in <xref target="depl"></xref>. The
      Configuration Payload Attribute Type defined in <xref
      target="RI"></xref> is not specific to these deployments, but can be
      used in other deployment contexts.</t>

      <t>Note that, for many years, typical designs has often considered that
      the DNS server was usually located inside the protected domain, but
      could theoretically be located outside of it. With DoH or DoT, the
      latter option becomes plausible.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>This document makes use of the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC8499"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-ter"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Also, this document makes use of the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC7296"></xref>. In particular, readers should be familiar with
      "initiator" and "responder" terms used in that document.</t>

      <t>Do53 refers to unencrypted DNS.</t>

      <t>'DoH/DoT' refers to DNS-over-HTTPS and/or DNS-over-TLS.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="depl" title="Sample Deployment Scenarios">
      <t>Networks are susceptible to internal attacks as discussed in Section
      3.2 of <xref target="I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t"></xref>. In all the
      following cases, hosting DoH/DoT server even in case of split-VPN
      configuration minimizes the attack vector (e.g., a compromised network
      device cannot monitor/modify DNS traffic). The objective is to restrict
      access to the DNS messages to only the parties that need to know.</t>

      <section title="Roaming Enterprise Users">
        <t>In this Enterprise scenario (Section 1.1.3 of <xref
        target="RFC7296"></xref>), a roaming user connects to the Enterprise
        network through an IPsec tunnel. The split-tunnel Virtual Private
        Network (VPN) configuration allows the endpoint to access hosts that
        resides in the Enterprise network <xref target="RFC8598"></xref> using
        that tunnel; other traffic not destined to the Enterprise does not
        traverse the tunnel. In contrast, a non-split-tunnel VPN configuration
        causes all traffic to traverse the tunnel into the enterprise.</t>

        <t>For both split- and non-split-tunnel configurations, the use of
        DoT/DoH instead of Do53 provides privacy and integrity protection
        along the entire path (rather than just to the VPN termination device)
        and can communicate the DoT/DoH server policies.</t>

        <t>For split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
        Enterprise-provided DoT/DoH server to resolve internal-only domain
        names.</t>

        <t>For non-split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
        Enterprise-provided DoT/DoH server to resolve both internal and
        external domain names.</t>

        <t>Enterprise networks are susceptible to internal and external
        attacks. To minimize that risk all enterprise traffic is encrypted
        (Section 2.1 of <xref
        target="I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t"></xref>).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="VPN Service Provider">
        <t>Legacy VPN service providers usually preserve end-users' data
        confidentiality by sending all communication traffic through an
        encrypted tunnel. A VPN service provider can also provide guarantees
        about the security of the VPN network by filtering malware and
        phishing domains.</t>

        <t>Browsers and OSes support DoH/DoT; VPN providers may no longer
        expect DNS clients to fallback to Do53 just because it is a closed
        network.</t>

        <t>The DoT/DoH server hosted by the VPN service provider can be
        securely discovered by the endpoint using the IKEv2 Configuration
        Payload Attribute Type.</t>

      candidate solutions for a DoH client to retrieve the list of supported
      templates by a DoH server. Also, if the resolver hosts several DoH
      services (e.g., no-filtering, blocking adult content, blocking malware),
      these services can be discovered as templates.</t>

      <t>This section will be updated to reflect the outcome of the discussion
      in <xref target="I-D.btw-add-home"></xref>.</t>

      <t>How a DoH client makes use of the configured DoH services is out of
      the scope of this document.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="protocol" title="IKEv2 Protocol Exchange">
      <t>This section describes how an initiator can be configured with an
      encrypted DNS server (e.g., DoH, DoT) using IKEv2.</t>

      <t>Initiators indicate the support of an encrypted DNS in the
      CFG_REQUEST payloads by including INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute, while
      responders supply the encrypted DNS configuration in the CFG_REPLY
      payloads. Concretely:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>If the initiator supports encrypted DNS, it includes one or more
          INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attributes in the CFG_REQUEST with the "Encrypted
          DNS Type" set to the requested encrypted DNS type (<xref
          target="RI"></xref>). For each supported encrypted DNS type the
          initiator MUST include exactly one INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute with
          the Length field set to 1.</t>

          <t>If an INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute is included in the CFG_REQUEST,
          the INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute MUST NOT include an ADN and list of
          IP addresses.</t>

          <t>For each INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute from the CFG_REQUEST, if the
          responder supports the corresponding encrypted DNS type, then it MAY
          send back an INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute in the CFG_REPLY with this
          encrypted DNS type and an appropriate list of IP addresses and ADN.
          The list of IP addresses MUST NOT be empty.</t>

          <t>If the CFG_REQUEST includes an INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute but the
          CFG_REPLY does not include an INTERNAL_ENC_DNS, this is an
          indication that requested encrypted DNS type(s) is not supported by
          the responder.</t>

          <t>The behavior of the responder if it receives both
          INTERNAL_ENC_DNS and INTERNAL_IP6_DNS (or INTERNAL_IP4_DNS)
          attributes is policy-based and deployment-specific. However, it is
          RECOMMENDED that if the responder includes at least one
          INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute in the reply, it should not include any
          of INTERNAL_IP4_DNS/INTERNAL_IP6_DNS attributes.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The DNS client establishes a DoH/DoT session with the address(es)
      conveyed in INTERNAL_ENC_DNS and uses the mechanism discussed in Section
      8 of <xref target="RFC8310"></xref> to authenticate the DNS server
      certificate using the authentication domain name conveyed in
      INTERNAL_ENC_DNS.</t>

      <t>If the IPsec connection is a split-tunnel configuration and the
      initiator negotiated INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN as per <xref
      target="RFC8598"></xref>, the DNS client MUST resolve the internal names
      using INTERNAL_ENC_DNS DNS servers.</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>Note: <xref target="RFC8598"></xref> requires INTERNAL_IP6_DNS
          (or INTERNAL_IP4_DNS) attribute to be mandatory present when
          INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN is included. This specification relaxes that
          constraint in the presence of INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document adheres to the security considerations defined in <xref
      target="RFC7296"></xref>. In particular, this document does not alter
      the trust on the DNS configuration provided by a responder.</t>

      <t>In most deployment scenarios, the initiator expects that it is using
      the DoH/DoT server hosted by a specific organization or enterprise. The
      DNS client can validate the signatory (i.e., cryptographically attested
      by the organization hosting the DoH/DoT server) using, for example,
      <xref target="I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection"></xref>, and the
      user can review human-readable privacy policy information of the DNS
      server and assess whether the DNS server performs DNS-based content
      filtering. This helps to protect from a compromised IKE server
      advertising a malicious DoH/DoT server.</t>

      <t>The initiator may trust the DoH/DoT servers supplied by means of
      IKEv2 from a trusted responder more than the locally provided DNS
      servers, especially in the case of connecting to unknown or untrusted
      networks (e.g., coffee shops or hotel networks). In addition, the
      initiator may prefer IKEv2-supplied DoH/DoT servers if they provide
      additional features (e.g., malware filtering) compared to the
      pre-configured DNS servers and meets the privacy preserving data policy
      requirements of the user.</t>

      <t>If the DoH/DoT server that was discovered by means of IKEv2 does not
      meet the privacy preserving data policy and filtering requirements of
      the user, the user can instruct the DNS client to take appropriate
      actions. For example, the action can be to use the local DoH/DoT server
      only to access internal-only DNS names and use another DNS server (that
      addresses his/her expectations) for public domains. Such actions and
      their handling is out of scope.</t>

      <t>If IKEv2 is being negotiated with an anonymous or unknown endpoint
      (such as for Opportunistic Security <xref target="RFC7435"></xref>), the
      initiator MUST NOT use INTERNAL_ENC_DNS servers unless it is
      pre-configured in the OS or the browser.</t>

      <t>This specification does not extend the scope of accepting DNSSEC
      trust anchors beyond the usage guidelines defined in Section 6 of <xref
      target="RFC8598"></xref>.</t>
