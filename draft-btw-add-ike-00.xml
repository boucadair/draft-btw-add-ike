      <t>This document specifies a new Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document specifies how an initiator can be configured with an
      encrypted DNS, particularly the Authentication Domain Name (ADN, defined
      in <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>) of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref> or DNS-over-TLS (DoT) <xref
      target="RFC7858"></xref> server using Internet Key Exchange Protocol
      Version 2 (IKEv2) <xref target="RFC7296"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Particularly, this document introduces a new IKEv2 Configuration
      Payload Attribute Types (<xref target="RI"></xref>) for the support of
      encrypted DNS servers (e.g., DoT, DoH).</t>

      <t>Sample use cases are discussed in <xref target="depl"></xref>. The
      Configuration Payload Attribute Type defined in <xref
      target="RI"></xref> is not specific to these deployments, but can be
      used in other deployment contexts.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>This document makes use of the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC8499"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-ter"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Also, this document makes use of the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC7296"></xref>. In particular, readers should be familiar with
      "initiator" and "responder" terms used in that document.</t>

      <t>Do53 refers to unencrypted DNS.</t>

      <t>'DoH/DoT' refers to DNS-over-HTTPS and/or DNS-over-TLS.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="depl" title="Sample Deployment Scenarios">
      <t>Networks are susceptible to internal attacks as discussed in <xref
      target="I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t"></xref>. In all the following
      cases, hosting DoH/DoT server even in case of split-VPN configuration
      minimizes the attack vector (e.g., a compromised network device cannot
      monitor/modify DNS traffic). The objective is to restrict access to the
      DNS messages only to the parties that need to know. </t>

      <section title="Roaming Enterprise Users">
        <t>In this Enterprise scenario (Section 1.1.3 of <xref
        target="RFC7296"></xref>), a roaming user connects to the Enterprise
        network through an IPsec tunnel. The split-tunnel Virtual Private
        Network (VPN) configuration may be used by the endpoint to only access
        information that resides in the Enterprise network <xref
        target="RFC8598"></xref> or all of the traffic is tunneled back
        through the Enterprise network in order to take advantage of the
        network security services (e.g., firewall). If the VPN client is
        configured to tunnel all traffic from the remote user to the security
        gateway, such a configuration is denoted as "non-split-tunnel VPN"
        configuration.</t>

        <t>For split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
        Enterprise-provided DoT/DoH server to resolve internal-only domain
        names. Usage of DoT/DoH instead of Do53 minimizes the risk of internal
        attacks.</t>

        <t>For non-split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
        Enterprise-provided DoT/DoH server to resolve both internal and
        external domain names.</t>

        <t>Note that, for many years, typical designs has often considered
        that the DNS server was usually located inside the protected domain,
        but could theoretically be located outside of it. With DoH or DoT, the
        latter option becomes plausible. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="VPN Service Provider">
        <t>Legacy VPN service providers usually preserve end-users' data
        confidentiality by sending all communication traffic through an
        encrypted tunnel. A VPN service provider can also provide guarantees
        about the security of the VPN network by filtering malware and
        phishing domains.</t>

        <t>The DoT/DoH server hosted by the VPN service provider can be
        securely discovered by the endpoint using the IKEv2 Configuration
        Payload Attribute Type.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Consistent DNS Configuration of Cellular Devices via &quot;Trusted&quot; and &quot;Untrusted&quot; Access Networks">
        <t>The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines the notion of
        "trusted" and "untrusted" access networks <xref
        target="TS23402"></xref>. For an "untrusted" non-3GPP access, the UE
        connects to the core network (e.g., 5G core network) via the Non-3GPP
        InterWorking Function (N3IWF). To that aim, the UE registers to the
        core network during the IKEv2 SA establishment procedure as specified
        in <xref target="TS24501"></xref>.</t>

        <t>For example, when the UE attaches to the network using a Wireless
        Local Area Network (WLAN) access by means of IKEv2 capabilities, the
        UE can be provided with an IPv4 address, an IPv6 prefix, a list of IP
        addresses of the DNS server. If the network supports DoT/DoH, there
        are no equivalent Configuration Payload Attribute Type(s) to the
        options defined in <xref target="I-D.btw-add-home"></xref>. The UE may
        discover other service information as discussed in <xref
        target="RFC7651"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The support of DoT/DoH IKEv2 attributes is meant to ensure a
        coherent configuration for UEs independently of the access network
        used by an UE to attach the network. For example, an UE may attach
        first to an "untrusted" access network and then hand over to a
        "trusted" network.</t>

        <t>The core network may utilize private names (Section 3.2 of <xref
        target="RFC6731"></xref>). As such, the cellular device needs to use
        the supplied DoT/DoH servers to resolve these names. The devices may
        be provided with a list of domains that must be resolved using the
        provided DoT/DoH servers <xref target="RFC8598"></xref>.</t>

      templates by a DoH server. Also, if the resolver hosts several DoH
      services (e.g., no-filtering, blocking adult content, blocking malware),
      these services can be discovered as templates.</t>

      <t>This section will be updated to reflect the outcome of the discussion

      <t>How a DoH client makes use of the configured DoH services is out of
      the scope of this document.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="protocol" title="IKEv2 Protocol Exchange">
      <t>This section describes how an initiator can be configured with an
      encrypted DNS server (e.g., DoH, DoT) using IKEv2.</t>

      <t>Initiators indicate the support of an encrypted DNS in the
      CFG_REQUEST payloads by including INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute, while
      responders supply the encrypted DNS configuration in the CFG_REPLY
      payloads or instruct the initiator to initiate a DHCP exchange
      (INTERNAL_IP6_DHCP (or INTERNAL_IP4_DHCP)). Concretely:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>If the initiator supports encrypted DNS, it includes an
          INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute in the CFG_REQUEST with the "Encrypted
          DNS Type" set to the requested encrypted DNS type (<xref
          target="RI"></xref>).</t>

          <t>If an INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute is included in the CFG_REQUEST,
          the INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute MUST NOT include an ADN and list of
          IP addresses. If any encypted DNS is requested by the client, then
          the INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute included in the CFG_REQUEST MUST be
          empty</t>

          <t>If the responder supports encrypted DNS (e.g., DoT or DoH), it
          MAY reply with one or more INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attributes in the
          CFG_REPLY payloads as a function of the requested encrypted DNS
          type(s). <xref target="app"></xref> summarizes the behavior of the
          responder. </t>

          <t>If the responder replies with INTERNAL_IP6_DHCP (or
          INTERNAL_IP4_DHCP), the initiator MUST follow the procedure defined
          in <xref target="I-D.btw-add-home"></xref> to retrieve the ADN of
          DoH/DoT server.</t>

          <t>If the CFG_REQUEST includes an INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute but the
          CFG_REPLY does not include an INTERNAL_ENC_DNS, this is an
          indication that requested encrypted DNS type(s) is not supported by
          the responder.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The DNS client establishes a DoH/DoT session with the address(es)
      conveyed in INTERNAL_ENC_DNS and uses the mechanism discussed in Section
      8 of <xref target="RFC8310"></xref> to authenticate the DNS server
      certificate using the authentication domain name conveyed in
      INTERNAL_ENC_DNS.</t>

      <t>Auto-upgrade considerations discussed in Section 6.1 of <xref
      target="I-D.btw-add-home"></xref> are also followed by the DNS
      client.</t>

      <t>If the initiator negotiated INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN as per <xref
      target="RFC8598"></xref>, the DNS client resolves the internal names
      using INTERNAL_ENC_DNS DNS servers.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document adheres to the security considerations defined in <xref
      target="RFC7296"></xref>. In particular, this document does not alter
      the trust on the DNS configuration provided by a responder.</t>

      <t>In most deployment scenarios, the initiator expects that it is using
      the DoH/DoT server hosted by a specific organization or enterprise. The
      DNS client can validate the signatory (i.e., cryptographically attested
      by the organization hosting the DoH/DoT server) using, for example,
      <xref target="I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection"></xref>, and the
      user can review human-readable privacy policy information of the DNS
      server and assess whether the DNS server performs DNS-based content
      filtering. This helps to protect from a compromised IKE server
      advertising a malicious DoH/DoT server.</t>

      <t>If the DoH/DoT server that was discovered by means of IKEv2 does not
      meet the privacy preserving data policy and filtering requirements of
      the user, the user can instruct the DNS client to take appropriate
      actions. For example, the action can be to use the local DoH/DoT server
      only to access internal-only DNS names and use another DNS server (that
      addresses his/her expectations) for public domains. Such actions and
      their handling is out of scope.</t>

      <t>The security considerations discussed in Section 9 of <xref
      target="I-D.btw-add-home"></xref> should be taken into account if the
      encrypted DNS information is supplied using DHCP.</t>

      <t>This specification does not extend the scope of accepting DNSSEC
      trust anchors beyond the usage guidelines defined in Section 6 of <xref
      target="RFC8598"></xref>. </t>
