    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document specifies how an initiator can be configured with the
      Authentication Domain Name (ADN, defined in <xref
      target="RFC8310"></xref>) of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref> or DNS-over-TLS (DoT) <xref
      target="RFC7858"></xref> server using Internet Key Exchange Protocol
      Version 2 (IKEv2) <xref target="RFC7296"></xref>. </t>

      <t>Particularly, this document introduces new IKEv2 Configuration
      Payload Attribute Type(s) (<xref target="RI"></xref>) and notification
      status types (<xref target="status"></xref>) for the support of DoT/DoT
      servers.</t>

      <t>Sample use cases are discussed in <xref target="depl"></xref>. The
      Configuration Payload Attribute Type(s) defined in <xref
      target="RI"></xref> are not specific to these deployments, but can be
      used in other deployment contexts. </t>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>This document makes use of the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC8499"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-ter"></xref>. </t>

      <t>Also, this document makes use of the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC7296"></xref>. In particular, readers should be familiar with
      "initiator" and "responder" terms used in that document.</t>

      <t>'DoH/DoT' refers to DNS-over-HTTPS and/or DNS-over-TLS.</t>

      <section title="Consistent DNS Configuration of Cellular Devices via &quot;Trusted&quot; and &quot;Untrusted&quot; Access Networks">
        <t>The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines the notion of
        "trusted" and "untrusted" access networks <xref
        target="TS23402"></xref>. For an "untrusted" non-3GPP access, the UE
        establishes a connection to the core network (e.g., 5G core network)
        via the Non-3GPP InterWorking Function (N3IWF). To that aim, the UE
        performs registration to the core network during the Internet Key
        Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) SA establishment procedure as
        specified in <xref target=" TS24501"></xref>.</t>

        <t>For example, when the UE attaches the network using a Wireless
        Local Area Network (WLAN) access by means of IKEv2 capabilities, the
        UE can be provided with an IPv4 address, an IPv6 prefix, a list of IP
        addresses of the DNS server. If the network supports DoT/DoH, there
        are no equivalent Configuration Payload Attribute Type(s) to the
        options defined in <xref target="I-D.btw-add-home"></xref> . </t>

        <t>The support of DoT/DoH IKEv2 attributes is meant to ensure a
        coherent configuration for UEs independently of the access network
        used by an UE to attach the network. For example, an UE may attach
        first to an "untrusted" access network and then hand over to a
        "trusted" network. </t>

    <section anchor="protocol" title="IKEv2 Protocol Exchange">
      <t>This section describes how an initiator can be configured with the
      ADN of DoH/DoT server using IKEv2.</t>

      <t>Initiators indicate the support of DoH/DoT in the CFG_REQUEST
      payloads by including INTERNAL_DNS_ADN attribute, while responders
      supply the DoT/DoH configuration in the CFG_REPLY payloads or instruct
      the initiator to initiate a DHCP exchange (INTERNAL_IP6_DHCP (or
      INTERNAL_IP4_DHCP)). Concretely:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>If an INTERNAL_DNS_ADN attribute is included in the CFG_REQUEST,
          the initiator MUST also include INTERNAL_IP4_DNS and/or
          INTERNAL_IP6_DNS attributes in the CFG_REQUEST. In such case, the
          INTERNAL_DNS_ADN attribute MUST be empty.</t>

          <t>If an INTERNAL_DNS_ADN is sent by the responder, the responder
          MUST also include one or more INTERNAL_IP4_DNS or INTERNAL_IP6_DNS
          attributes that contain the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the internal DNS
          server.</t>

          <t>If the responder replies with INTERNAL_IP6_DHCP (or
          INTERNAL_IP4_DHCP), the initiator MUST follow the procedure defined
          in <xref target="I-D.btw-add-home"></xref> to retrieve the ADN of
          DoH/DoT server.</t>

          <t>If the CFG_REQUEST includes an INTERNAL_DNS_ADN attribute but the
          CFG_REPLY does not include an INTERNAL_DNS_ADN attribute, this is an
          indication that DoT/DoH is not supported by the DNS server reachable
          at INTERNAL_IP4_DNS or INTERNAL_IP6_DNS.</t>

          <t>If the CFG_REQUEST does not include an INTERNAL_DNS_ADN
          attribute, and absent any policy, the responder MAY reply with
          INTERNAL_IP4_DNS or INTERNAL_IP6_DNS attributes. If the responder
          supports DoT/DoH, it MAY include an ENCRYPTED_DNS_ALLOWED
          notification status to inform the initiator that its supports
          DoT/DoH. If the initiator didn't include INTERNAL_DNS_ADN attribute
          in the CFG_REQUEST, but receives ENCRYPTED_DNS_ALLOWED notification
          status from the responder, the initiator MAY send a request with the
          INTERNAL_DNS_ADN attribute.</t>

          <t>If the CFG_REQUEST does not include an INTERNAL_DNS_ADN attribute
          and the responder only supports encrypted DNS, the responder MUST
          reply with DO53_DISABLED notification status. Upon receipt of such
          notification by a DoT/DoH capable initiator, it MUST send a request
          with the INTERNAL_DNS_ADN attribute.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The DNS client establishes a DoH/DoT session with the address(es)
      conveyed in INTERNAL_IP6_DNS (or INTERNAL_IP4_DNS) and uses the
      mechanism discussed in Section 8 of <xref target="RFC8310"></xref> to
      authenticate the DNS server certificate using the authentication domain
      name conveyed in INTERNAL_DNS_ADN.</t>
