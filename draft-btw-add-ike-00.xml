    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document specifies how an initiator can be configured with the
      Authentication Domain Name (ADN, defined in <xref
      target="RFC8310"></xref>) of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref> or DNS-over-TLS (DoT) <xref
      target="RFC7858"></xref> server using Internet Key Exchange Protocol
      Version 2 (IKEv2) <xref target="RFC7296"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Particularly, this document introduces new IKEv2 Configuration
      Payload Attribute Types (<xref target="RI"></xref>) for the support of
      DoT/DoT servers.</t>

      <t>Sample use cases are discussed in <xref target="depl"></xref>. The
      Configuration Payload Attribute Types defined in <xref
      target="RI"></xref> are not specific to these deployments, but can be
      used in other deployment contexts.</t>

      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and

    <section anchor="depl" title="Sample Deployment Scenarios">
      <t></t>

      <section title="Consistent DNS Configuration of Cellular Devices via &quot;Trusted&quot; and &quot;Untrusted&quot; Access Networks">
        <t>The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines the notion of
        "trusted" and "untrusted" access networks <xref
        target="TS23402"></xref>. For an "untrusted" non-3GPP access, the UE
        connects to the core network (e.g., 5G core network) via the Non-3GPP
        InterWorking Function (N3IWF). To that aim, the UE registers to the
        core network during the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2
        (IKEv2) SA establishment procedure as specified in <xref
        target="TS24501"></xref>.</t>

        <t>For example, when the UE attaches to the network using a Wireless
        Local Area Network (WLAN) access by means of IKEv2 capabilities, the
        UE can be provided with an IPv4 address, an IPv6 prefix, a list of IP
        addresses of the DNS server. If the network supports DoT/DoH, there
        are no equivalent Configuration Payload Attribute Type(s) to the
        options defined in <xref target="I-D.btw-add-home"></xref> .</t>

        <t>The support of DoT/DoH IKEv2 attributes is meant to ensure a
        coherent configuration for UEs independently of the access network
        used by an UE to attach the network. For example, an UE may attach
        first to an "untrusted" access network and then hand over to a
        "trusted" network.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Roaming Users">
        <t>In this Enterprise scenario, a roaming user connects to the
        Enterprise network through an IPsec tunnel. The split-tunnel Virtual
        Private Network (VPN) configuration may be used by the endpoint to
        only access information that resides in the Enterprise network <xref
        target="RFC8598"></xref> or all of the traffic is tunneled back
        through the Enterprise network in order to take advantage of the
        network security services (e.g., firewall). If the VPN client is
        configured to tunnel all traffic from the remote user to the security
        gateway, such a configuration is denoted as "non-split-tunnel VPN"
        configuration.</t>

        <t>For split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
        Enterprise-provided DoT/DoH server to resolve internal-only domain
        names. Usage of DoT/DoH instead of Do53 minimizes the risk of internal
        attacks.</t>

        <t>For non-split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
        Enterprise-provided DoT/DoH server to resolve both internal and
        external domain names.</t>

        <t>Note that, for many years, typical designs has often considered
        that the DNS server was usually located inside the protected domain,
        but could theoretically be located outside of it. With DoH or DoT, the
        latter option becomes very likely.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="VPN Service Provider">
        <t>Legacy VPN service providers usually preserve end-users' data
        confidentiality by sending all communication traffic through an
        encrypted tunnel. A VPN service provider can also provide guarantees
        about the security of the VPN network by filtering malware and
        phishing domains.</t>

        <t>The DoT/DoH server hosted by the VPN service provider can be
        securely discovered by the endpoint using the IKEv2 Configuration
        Payload Attribute Type.</t>

    <section anchor="protocol" title="IKEv2 Protocol Exchange">
      <t>This section describes how an initiator can be configured with the
      ADN of DoH/DoT server using IKEv2.</t>

      <t>Initiators indicate the support of DoT (and/or DoH) in the
      CFG_REQUEST payloads by including INTERNAL_DOT_ADN (and/or
      INTERNAL_DOH_ADN) attribute, while responders supply the DoT/DoH
      configuration in the CFG_REPLY payloads or instruct the initiator to
      initiate a DHCP exchange (INTERNAL_IP6_DHCP (or INTERNAL_IP4_DHCP)).
      Concretely:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
          <t>If an INTERNAL_DOT_ADN or INTERNAL_DOH_ADN attribute is included
          in the CFG_REQUEST, the initiator MUST also include INTERNAL_IP4_DNS
          and/or INTERNAL_IP6_DNS attributes in the CFG_REQUEST. In such case,
          the INTERNAL_DOT_ADN (or INTERNAL_DOH_ADN) attribute MUST be
          empty.</t>

          <t>If the responder supports DoT (or DoH), it MAY reply with an
          INTERNAL_DOT_ADN (or INTERNAL_DOH_ADN) attribute in the CFG_REPLY
          payloads.</t>

          <t>If an INTERNAL_DOT_ADN (or INTERNAL_DOH_ADN) is sent by the
          responder, the responder MUST also include one or more
          INTERNAL_IP4_DNS or INTERNAL_IP6_DNS attributes that contain the
          IPv4 or IPv6 address of the internal DNS server.</t>

          <t>If Do53 and DoT/DoH are hosted on different IP addresses, and if
          the initiator indicates support for DoT/DoH, then the
          INTERNAL_IP4_DNS or INTERNAL_IP6_DNS attributes include the DoT/DoH
          server IP addresses followed by Do53 server IP addresses. </t>

          <t>If the responder replies with INTERNAL_IP6_DHCP (or
          INTERNAL_IP4_DHCP), the initiator MUST follow the procedure defined
          in <xref target="I-D.btw-add-home"></xref> to retrieve the ADN of
          DoH/DoT server.</t>

          <t>If the CFG_REQUEST includes an INTERNAL_DOT_ADN or
          INTERNAL_DOH_ADN attributes but the CFG_REPLY does only include an
          INTERNAL_DNS_ADN attribute, this is an indication that DoT/DoH is
          not supported by the DNS server reachable at INTERNAL_IP4_DNS or
          INTERNAL_IP6_DNS.</t>

          <t>If the CFG_REQUEST does not include an INTERNAL_DOT_ADN or
          INTERNAL_DOH_ADN attribute, and in the absence of policy, the
          responder MAY reply with INTERNAL_IP4_DNS or INTERNAL_IP6_DNS
          attributes.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t><xref target="app"> </xref> summarizes the behavior of the
      responder.</t>

      <t>The DNS client establishes a DoH/DoT session with the address(es)
      conveyed in INTERNAL_IP6_DNS (or INTERNAL_IP4_DNS) and uses the
      mechanism discussed in Section 8 of <xref target="RFC8310"></xref> to
      authenticate the DNS server certificate using the authentication domain
      name conveyed in INTERNAL_DOT_ADN (or INTERNAL_DOH_ADN).</t>

      <t>Auto-upgrade considerations discussed in Section 6.1 of <xref
      target="I-D.btw-add-home"></xref> are also followed by the DNS
      client.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document adheres to the security considerations defined in <xref
      target="RFC7296"></xref>. In particular, this document does not alter
      the trust on the DNS configuration provided by a responder.</t>

      <t>In most deployment scenarios, the initiator expects that it is using
      the DoH/DoT server hosted by a specific organization or enterprise. The
      DNS client can validate the signatory (i.e., cryptographically attested
      by the organization hosting the DoH/DoT server) using, for example,
      <xref target="I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection"></xref>, and the
      user can review human-readable privacy policy information of the DNS
      server and assess whether the DNS server performs DNS-based content
      filtering. This helps to protect from a compromised IKE server
      advertising a malicious DoH/DoT server.</t>

      <t>If the DoH/DoT server that was discovered by means of IKEv2 does not
      meet the privacy preserving data policy and filtering requirements of
      the user, the user can instruct the DNS client to take appropriate
      actions. For example, the action can be to use the local DoH/DoT server
      only to access internal-only DNS names and use another DNS server (that
      addresses his/her expectations) for public domains. Such actions and
      their handling is out of scope.</t>

      <t>The security considerations discussed in Section 9 of <xref
      target="I-D.btw-add-home"></xref> should be taken into account if the
      encrypted DNS information is supplied using DHCP.</t>
