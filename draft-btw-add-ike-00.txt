1.  Introduction

   This document specifies how an initiator can be configured with the
   Authentication Domain Name (ADN, defined in [RFC8310]) of DNS-over-
   HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484] or DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858] server using
   Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC7296].

   Particularly, this document introduces a new IKEv2 Configuration
   Payload Attribute Types (Section 4) for the support of DoT/DoT
   servers.

   Sample use cases are discussed in Section 3.  The Configuration
   Payload Attribute Type defined in Section 4 is not specific to these
   deployments, but can be used in other deployment contexts.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

Internet-Draft              IKEv2 for DoH/DoT                 March 2020


   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499] and
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-ter].

   Also, this document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC7296].  In
   particular, readers should be familiar with "initiator" and
   "responder" terms used in that document.

   Do53 refers to unencrypted DNS.

   'DoH/DoT' refers to DNS-over-HTTPS and/or DNS-over-TLS.

3.  Sample Deployment Scenarios

3.1.  Consistent DNS Configuration of Cellular Devices via "Trusted" and
      "Untrusted" Access Networks

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defines the notion of
   "trusted" and "untrusted" access networks [TS23402].  For an
   "untrusted" non-3GPP access, the UE connects to the core network
   (e.g., 5G core network) via the Non-3GPP InterWorking Function
   (N3IWF).  To that aim, the UE registers to the core network during
   the IKEv2 SA establishment procedure as specified in [TS24501].

   For example, when the UE attaches to the network using a Wireless
   Local Area Network (WLAN) access by means of IKEv2 capabilities, the
   UE can be provided with an IPv4 address, an IPv6 prefix, a list of IP
   addresses of the DNS server.  If the network supports DoT/DoH, there
   are no equivalent Configuration Payload Attribute Type(s) to the
   options defined in [I-D.btw-add-home].  The UE may discover other
   service information as discussed in [RFC7651].

   The support of DoT/DoH IKEv2 attributes is meant to ensure a coherent
   configuration for UEs independently of the access network used by an
   UE to attach the network.  For example, an UE may attach first to an
   "untrusted" access network and then hand over to a "trusted" network.

3.2.  Roaming Enterprise Users

   In this Enterprise scenario, a roaming user connects to the
   Enterprise network through an IPsec tunnel.  The split-tunnel Virtual
   Private Network (VPN) configuration may be used by the endpoint to
   only access information that resides in the Enterprise network
   [RFC8598] or all of the traffic is tunneled back through the
   Enterprise network in order to take advantage of the network security
   services (e.g., firewall).  If the VPN client is configured to tunnel
   all traffic from the remote user to the security gateway, such a
   configuration is denoted as "non-split-tunnel VPN" configuration.

Internet-Draft              IKEv2 for DoH/DoT                 March 2020


   For split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
   Enterprise-provided DoT/DoH server to resolve internal-only domain
   names.  Usage of DoT/DoH instead of Do53 minimizes the risk of
   internal attacks.

   For non-split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
   Enterprise-provided DoT/DoH server to resolve both internal and
   external domain names.

   Note that, for many years, typical designs has often considered that
   the DNS server was usually located inside the protected domain, but
   could theoretically be located outside of it.  With DoH or DoT, the
   latter option becomes plausible.

3.3.  VPN Service Provider

   Legacy VPN service providers usually preserve end-users' data
   confidentiality by sending all communication traffic through an
   encrypted tunnel.  A VPN service provider can also provide guarantees
   about the security of the VPN network by filtering malware and
   phishing domains.

   The DoT/DoH server hosted by the VPN service provider can be securely
   discovered by the endpoint using the IKEv2 Configuration Payload
   Attribute Type.

4.  INTERNAL_ENC_DNS_ADN Attribute

   The INTERNAL_ENC_DNS_ADN IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Type
   is used to configure an encrypted DNS server.  The format of this
   attribute is shown in Figure 1.

              Figure 1: INTERNAL_ENC_DNS_ADN Attribute Format

   The fields of the attribute shown in Figure 1 are as follows:

   o  R: Reserved bit; refer to Section 3.15.1 of [RFC7296].

   o  Attribute Type: MUST be set to TBA (Section 8).

   o  Length: Length of the data in octets.

   o  Encrypted DNS Type: Indicates the type of the encrypted DNS
      conveyed in this attribute.  The following values are supported:

         0: Any encrypted DNS

         1: DoT

         2: DoH

   o  ADN Length Length: Length of the DNS Authentication Domain Name
      field in octets.

   o  Authentication Domain Name: A fully qualified domain name of the
      DoT (or DoH) server following the syntax defined in [RFC5890].
      The name MUST NOT contain any terminators (e.g., NULL, CR).

      An example of valid ADN for DoH server is "doh1.example.com".

   o  IPv6 Address(es): One or more IPv6 addresses to be used to reach
      the encrypted DNS identified by the name in the DNS Authentication

      Domain Name.  The number of included IP addresses is (Length - 4 -
      ADN Length)/16.

      IPv4 addresses MUST be encoded using the IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address
      format defined in [RFC4291].


5.  URI Template

   DoH servers may support more than one URI Template [RFC8484].  The
   following sub-sections discuss some candidate solutions for a DoH
   client to retrieve the list of supported templates by a DoH server.
   Also, if the resolver hosts several DoH services (e.g., no-filtering,
   blocking adult content, blocking malware), these services can be
   discovered as templates.

   This section will be updated to reflect the outcome of the discussion
   in [I-D.btw-add-home].

   How a DoH client makes use of the configured DoH services is out of
   the scope of this document.

6.  IKEv2 Protocol Exchange

   This section describes how an initiator can be configured with an
   encrypted DNS server (e.g., DoH, DoT) using IKEv2.

   Initiators indicate the support of an encrypted DNS in the
   CFG_REQUEST payloads by including INTERNAL_ENC_DNS_ADN attribute,
   while responders supply the encrypted DNS configuration in the
   CFG_REPLY payloads or instruct the initiator to initiate a DHCP
   exchange (INTERNAL_IP6_DHCP (or INTERNAL_IP4_DHCP)).  Concretely:

      If the initiator supports encrypted DNS, it includes an
      INTERNAL_ENC_DNS_ADN attribute in the CFG_REQUEST with the
      "Encrypted DNS Type" set to the requested encrypted DNS type
      (Section 4).

      If an INTERNAL_ENC_DNS_ADN attribute is included in the
      CFG_REQUEST, the INTERNAL_ENC_DNS_ADN attribute MUST NOT include
      an ADN and list of IP addresses.  If any encypted DNS is requested
      by the client, then the INTERNAL_ENC_DNS_ADN attribute included in
      the CFG_REQUEST MUST be empty

      If the responder supports encrypted DNS (e.g., DoT or DoH), it MAY
      reply with one or more INTERNAL_ENC_DNS_ADN attributes in the
      CFG_REPLY payloads as a function of the requested encrypted DNS
      type(s).  Appendix A summarizes the behavior of the responder.

Internet-Draft              IKEv2 for DoH/DoT                 March 2020


      If the responder replies with INTERNAL_IP6_DHCP (or
      INTERNAL_IP4_DHCP), the initiator MUST follow the procedure
      defined in [I-D.btw-add-home] to retrieve the ADN of DoH/DoT
      server.

      If the CFG_REQUEST includes an INTERNAL_ENC_DNS_ADN attribute but
      the CFG_REPLY does not include an INTERNAL_ENC_DNS_ADN, this is an
      indication that requested encrypted DNS type(s) is not supported
      by the responder.

   The DNS client establishes a DoH/DoT session with the address(es)
   conveyed in INTERNAL_ENC_DNS_ADN and uses the mechanism discussed in
   Section 8 of [RFC8310] to authenticate the DNS server certificate
   using the authentication domain name conveyed in
   INTERNAL_ENC_DNS_ADN.

   Auto-upgrade considerations discussed in Section 6.1 of
   [I-D.btw-add-home] are also followed by the DNS client.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document adheres to the security considerations defined in
   [RFC7296].  In particular, this document does not alter the trust on
   the DNS configuration provided by a responder.

   In most deployment scenarios, the initiator expects that it is using
   the DoH/DoT server hosted by a specific organization or enterprise.
   The DNS client can validate the signatory (i.e., cryptographically
   attested by the organization hosting the DoH/DoT server) using, for
   example, [I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection], and the user can
   review human-readable privacy policy information of the DNS server
   and assess whether the DNS server performs DNS-based content
   filtering.  This helps to protect from a compromised IKE server
   advertising a malicious DoH/DoT server.

   If the DoH/DoT server that was discovered by means of IKEv2 does not
   meet the privacy preserving data policy and filtering requirements of
   the user, the user can instruct the DNS client to take appropriate
   actions.  For example, the action can be to use the local DoH/DoT
   server only to access internal-only DNS names and use another DNS
   server (that addresses his/her expectations) for public domains.
   Such actions and their handling is out of scope.

   The security considerations discussed in Section 9 of
   [I-D.btw-add-home] should be taken into account if the encrypted DNS
   information is supplied using DHCP.

   This specification does not extend the scope of accepting DNSSEC
   trust anchors beyond the usage guidelines defined in Section 6 of
   [RFC8598].

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Configuration Payload Attribute Type

   This document requests IANA to assign the following new IKEv2
   Configuration Payload Attribute Types from the "IKEv2 Configuration
   Payload Attribute Types" namespace available at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/ikev2-parameters/
   ikev2-parameters.xhtml#ikev2-parameters-21.

                                    Multi-
      Value    Attribute Type       Valued  Length      Reference
      ------   -------------------  ------  ----------  ------------
      TBA      INTERNAL_ENC_DNS_ADN   YES   0 or more    RFC XXXX


8.2.  Encrypted DNS Types

   This document requests IANA to create a new registery called
   "Encrypted DNS Types" under "Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)
   Parameters" available at https://www.iana.org/assignments/ikev2-
   parameters/ikev2-parameters.xhtml#ikev2-parameters-21.  The initial
   values of the registery is as follows:

                    +-------+-------------+-----------+
                    | Value | Description | Reference |
                    +-------+-------------+-----------+
                    | 0     | Any         | RFC XXXX  |
                    | 1     | DoT         | RFC XXXX  |
                    | 2     | DoH         | RFC XXXX  |
                    +-------+-------------+-----------+

   New values are registered via Specification Required [RFC8126].

9.  Acknowledgements

   Many thanks to Yoan Nir, Christian Jacquenet, Paul Wouters for the
   review and comments.

   Yoav and Paul suggested the use of one single attribute carrying both
   the name and an IP address instead of depending on the existing
   INTERNAL_IP6_DNS and INTERNAL_IP4_DNS attributes.
